# Song-Guesser

\# 1) Info
This is the base for a Heardle like song guesser using Youtube's iframe APIs

Open the "BaseGame.html" to start the game within a server. Currently I am using python -m http.server (Port Chosen) to host locally.
In "Song-Guesser/tracks.json" change the values of the songs to whatever you like to start guessing songs. (Songs with Ads are currently not supported)



\# 2) Open
http://localhost:(Your Port)/BaseGame.html



\# 3) API
DB interaction APIs are currently being worked on and are not implemented.
